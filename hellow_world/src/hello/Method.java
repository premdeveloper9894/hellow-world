		 * PRE-DEFINED METHOD  [ system.out.println , math() ]
		 * 
		 *             A Predefined method in java refers to a method that is already defined in 
		 *     Java Standard Library.
		 *             It's save time and effort by providing commoonly used functional

		 * A pre-defined method is a method already written by Java that you can directly call.
		 * println() is a pre-defined method.
