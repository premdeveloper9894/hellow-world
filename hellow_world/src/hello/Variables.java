    /*  Type of Variables
      
       1)	Based on datatypes- Primitive & Non-Primitive
       2)	Based on scope- Local variable,static &Nonstatic 


      1.Local varibale:
           > A Variable declare inside the Method is Called Local variable
           > temp data
      2.instant Varibale:
          > Instant variable Should be declared within the class directly,but outside method
          > Object variable data
      3.Static Variable:
          > No Need create Object in Static Variable
          >Static Variable take a one cope(Value) to use  multiple thread.
          >A static variable is shared by all objects of a class, and it has only one copy in memory.
          >If Declare outside the class use multiple time
          > Class Level Data
          
          eg: Any App name
          
          
          Global variable:
            >  A variable that can be used anywhere in the program.
