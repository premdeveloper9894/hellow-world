WHAT IS JAVA:

     > Java is high lever object oriented programing language designed to platform independed ,
       it's meaning code writted in java can run any device with a jvm . It was created by JAMES GOSLLING
       and released by SUN MICROSYSTEM in 1995.
     > Today it's widely used in web , mobile ,desktop and enteprice application.
     
CURRENT VERSION:
     JAVA SE  25,  release as of September 2025.

STRUCTURE OF JAVA PROGRAM

   >Create a file , Compilation, Execute.
   
 MEANING FOR PLATFORM (OS)
   
   >Platform indepentent
       Write Once run anywhere
       
   >Platform Depends
       Can Run only on specific operating system
       
 TOKEN 
 
     >Token are nothing ,but smallest component of any programing Language.
     >Programing Language Should also have alphabets & words that is Called as token.
     
 CONVENTION:-

        Convention are nothing but industry standard. programmer we have to follow.
 With respect to naming convention we have to upper camel case means every 1st letter should be in capital Letter.
 
 
 PLATFORM:
    Hardware and Software is called platform.



JAVA COMPLIER:
    > Java complier is program that translate java source code into bytecode. 
    then byte code execute by the java virtual machine (JVM)
    
          * Translation: Convert human - relatable java code into machine code
          * error detection : check for syntax error in  the source code during the compilation code process.
          * Optimization : Optimizes the byte code for better performance.
          
          
 Object - Oriented:
       Focuses on objects and classes , making code reusable and modular.
       
 Robust : Includes String memory Management, exception handi=ling and garbage collection System.  
 
 Garbage collection : is the process by which the (JVM ) Automatically 
                   removes unused objects from memory to free-up space and improve performance.
                   
 Wrappper Class: 
          > Wrapper class provided a way to use primitive data type
          > Wrapper class provided the machanism  to convert primitve into obj and obj into primitive.
 INTERVIEW QUESION:
      invalid error in java:
      * Stackoverflow
      *  outofmemoryerror
      
      
                JVM Memory
   ------------------------
   |       Stack          |  <-- Stores method calls, local variables
   |----------------------|
   | main()               |
   | recursive()          |
   | recursive()          |
   | ...                  |
   ------------------------
        ↑
        |   If too many method calls (deep recursion)
        |   → StackOverflowError
        ↓
   ------------------------
   |        Heap          |  <-- Stores objects, arrays, class instances
   |----------------------|
   | new Object()         |
   | new int[1000000]     |
   | ...                  |
   ------------------------
        ↑
        |   If too many objects or very large objects allocated
        |   → OutOfMemoryError
        ↓
